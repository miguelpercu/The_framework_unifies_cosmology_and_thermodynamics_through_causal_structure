## Overview

The Unified Causal Principle (UCP) is a theoretical framework that introduces a new fundamental constant, κ_crit (≈10⁻⁷⁸), which simultaneously:
- Resolves the Hubble Tension by predicting H₀ = 72.16 km/s/Mpc
- Establishes perfect entropic equilibrium (dS/dt_net = 0) at the Planck scale

This repository contains the Python code and documentation for the UCP framework, including numerical verifications and testable predictions for the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN).

## Key Results

- **Hubble Constant**: H₀ = 72.16 km/s/Mpc (resolving the 4.5σ tension between Planck and SH0ES)
- **Entropic Equilibrium**: Net entropy production rate dS/dt_net = 0 at the Planck scale
- **Fundamental Constant**: κ_crit ≈ 1.0 × 10⁻⁷⁸ (dimensionless)

## Testable Predictions

- **CMB**: Shift of the first acoustic peak to ℓ ≈ 214.3 (from ΛCDM's 200)
- **BBN**: Modifications in primordial abundances (Y_p: +0.57%, D/H: -1.43%)

## Usage
